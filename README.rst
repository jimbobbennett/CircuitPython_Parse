Parse (absolute and relative) URLs.

This code is taken from the `CPython Parse library <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/urllib/parse.py>`_, and tweaked to work under CircuitPython.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_.

Installing from PyPI
=====================
.. note:: This library is not available on PyPI yet. Install documentation is included
   as a standard element. Stay tuned for PyPI availability!

On supported GNU/Linux systems like the Raspberry Pi, you can install the driver locally `from
PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-parse/>`_. To install for current user:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circuitpython-parse

To install system-wide (this may be required in some cases):

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo pip3 install circuitpython-parse

To install in a virtual environment in your current project:

.. code-block:: shell

    mkdir project-name && cd project-name
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip3 install circuitpython-parse

Usage Example
=============

Parse a URL.

.. code-block:: python

    url = "https://docs.microsoft.com/Learn?WT.mc_id=academic-0000-jabenn"

    scheme, netloc, path, params, query, fragment = parse.urlparse(url)

    print("Scheme", scheme)
    print("Netloc", netloc)
    print("Path", path)
    print("Params", params)
    print("Query", query)
    print("Fragment", fragment)
